# NW.js starter

This is a sample project to get you up and running with [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/). Here's a screenshot from one of my apps that I created with this kit:

![Cross-platform screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Features

* Native notifications
* Auto update
* Use Gulp to build, sign, pack and upload the app
* Remembers window position when closed
* Customizable settings in the right-click menu
  * Run as menu bar app
  * Launch on OS startup
  * Open links in the browser

What doesn't work:

* Tray icon on linux

## Pre-requisites

    # install gulp
    npm install -g gulp

    # install dependencies
    npm install

* **wine**: If you're on OS X/Linux and want to build for Windows, you need [Wine](http://winehq.org/) installed. Wine is required in order
to set the correct icon for the exe. If you don't have Wine, you can comment out the `winIco` field in `gulpfile`.
* **makensis**: Required by the `pack:win32` task in `gulpfile` to create the Windows installer.
* [**fpm**](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm): Required by the `pack:linux{32|64}:deb` tasks in `gulpfile` to create the Linux installers.

Quickly install this on OS X:

    brew install wine makensis
    sudo gem install fpm

## Build

### OS X: pack the app in a .dmg

    gulp pack:osx64

### Windows: create the installer

    gulp pack:win32

### Linux 32/64-bit: pack the app in a .deb

    gulp pack:linux{32|64}:deb

The output is in `./dist`. Take a look at `gulpfile.coffee` for additional tasks.

**TIP**: use the `--toolbar` parameter to quickly build the app with the toolbar on. E.g. `gulp build:win32 --toolbar`.

**TIP**: use `gulp build:win32 --noicon` to quickly build the Windows app without the icon, which normally takes some seconds.

**TIP**: for OS X, use the `run:osx64` task to build the app and run it immediately.
